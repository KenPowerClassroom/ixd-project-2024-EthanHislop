  <h2>Introduction</h2>
  <p>Welcome to the introduction page of my interactive design project for 2024, which is centered around the gamification of a learning app.
  The aim of this is to provide a learning experience that is both engaging and fun to interact with for our users.</p>
  <p>The term gamification refers to the applying of game design principles to contexts where they typically would not be present, such as education.
  The objective of gamification is to increase user motivation, engagement and enjoyment.</p>
  <p>This project included various phases, such as a competitive analysis, wireframing, prototyping and usability testing.
  The competitive analysis has helped me identify the strengths and weaknesses within the market, and reveal areas where improvement can be made.</p>
  <p>Wireframing and prototyping allowed us to design and develop the interface and user experience of the app, which ensures a smooth and enjoyable experience while learning.</p>
  <p>Lastly, usability testing was then conducted to gather the necessary feedback from users who have helped in testing the usability and functionality of the app.
  This ensures that the needs of the users are met.</p>
  <p>The overall aim of this is to create a learning app that is both effective and enjoyable, which should improve the users learning.</p>
