          <td id="kahoot-progress">Kahoot keeps track of your score during a quiz using a leaderboard alongside anyone else who is playing.
            This allows you to keep track of whos in the lead. There is feedback for when you get a question wrong, as it shows the right answer in green after the timer has ended. However, there are no recommendations or personalization in the overall app. 
            You can only choose the quizes based on searches or just random quizes that pop up and there's no real personalization. (8/10)</td>
          <td id="typing-progress">Typing.com keeps track of your progress as you complete lessons. This is indicated using a progress bar at each stage. Immediate feedback is given when the wrong key is pressed.
            Accuracy percentages are given every time you complete a task and at the end of every stage. There is not personalization based on learning present in Typing.com. (9/10)</td>
          <td id="code-progress">CodeCombat uses a level progression system to keep track of player progress, meaning you can always return to a level later on. There is a level up system as you gain XP from completing levels and also from earning achievments. There is also a gem system that unlocks new coding abilities and stat modifiers.
            It provides immediate feedback if the user enters incorrect code as you can run it and restart any time you have made a mistake, along with hints if you need them. While it does not seem to use data to personalize the experience, it does have manual adjustments such a different code languages and code structure. (8/10)</td>

            The interface, while simple, is designed well. (10/10)</td>
          <td id="code-experience">CodeCombat is simple enough to navigate, my only complaint is that the game map is a little clunky and crowded and sometimes hard to read. It gives clear instructions of what the user needs to do in a level and what function they have available to them.
            The interface is very well designed and fits the app theme and setting well. (8/10)</td>
