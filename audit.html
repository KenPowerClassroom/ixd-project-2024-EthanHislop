            It has colourful visuals and animations. The user can choose from a variety of user created quizes of various difficulty and topics. (10/10)</td>

          <td id="kahoot-progress">Kahoot keeps track of your score during a quiz using a leaderboard alongside anyone else who is playing.
            This allows you to keep track of whos in the lead. There is feedback for when you get a question wrong, as it shows the right answer in green after the timer has ended. However, there are no recommendations or personalization in the overall app. 
            You can only choose the quizes based on searches or just random quizes and there's no real personalization. (5/10)</td>
